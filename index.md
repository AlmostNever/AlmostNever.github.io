**I am a prospective law student with a strong focus on public interest law.**

I completed a BS in Math at the University of Pittsburgh in 2018, and I plan to complete an MS in Math at the University of Pittsburgh in 2024. I'll start law school in fall 2024, and am currently looking for public-interest internships.

**I am also a trans woman.** 

Did you know that, without fee waivers or publication waivers, it costs around $400 to legally change your name in Allegheny County? Have you had someone from a red state explain to you the intricacy and necessity of grey market hormone replacement therapy? Would you like to face a Scyllaeo-Charybdean choice every time you use a public restroom south of the Mason-Dixon line? Transition; it'll be an illuminating experience.

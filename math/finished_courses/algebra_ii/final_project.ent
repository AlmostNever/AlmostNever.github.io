macro:->Other
important
figures
in
the
development
of
this
theory
have
been
Wolfgang
Krull,
who
discovered
it
in
the
specific
case
of
ideals
over
a
commutative
ring;
Goro
Azumaya,
who
formulated
it
in
a
more
general
form,
possibly
before
Nakayama,
and
Nathan
Jacobson,
who
formulated
the
noncommutative
version
of
the
lemma
in
1945.
This
same
lemma
has
been
called
the
``Krull-Azumaya
Lemma,''
even
just
``Azumaya's
Lemma,''
and
the
noncommutative
form
is
often
called
the
``Jacobson-Azumaya
Lemma.''
\par
I
found
the
general
history
of
this
lemma,
and
notes
about
its
various
names,
in
Appendix
$A.2$
of
Nagata's
1962
book
on
Local
Rings,
\cite
{nagata}.
